# What to Do After You Appeal a Rejection from the Apple App Store

If you've recently gone through the process of appealing an App Store rejection,
it's normal to feel a combination of anticipation and uncertainty. Here are the
steps you should expect after submitting your appeal and some tips on how to
proceed.

## After You Submit Your Appeal

Once you have submitted your appeal through the [App Store
Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) portal, the App Review Board will
review your submission and make a determination. This process may take from a
few days to a couple of weeks, depending on the complexity of your appeal (check
out [this](https://www.runway.team/appreviewtimes) website for current review
times estimate).

## Possible Outcomes

- **Approval**: Your app will be allowed to enter or re-enter the App Store.
- **Further Rejection**: You may receive additional feedback or clarifications
  on the rejection reasons.

## Next Steps Based on Outcomes

### If Your App Gets Approved

1. **Review Feedback**: Even after a successful appeal, the review team may
   provide suggestions or feedbackâ€”make sure to review it carefully for future
   submissions.
2. **Prepare for Release**: Adjust your app's release date if necessary and
   finalize marketing and promotional activities.
3. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on your app's performance, user reviews,
   and crash reports to ensure a quality user experience.

### If Your App is Still Rejected

1. **Understand the Feedback**: Carefully read the reasons why your app remains
   rejected. If you have questions, ask for clarification.
2. **Make Necessary Changes**: Address all the issues mentioned by the review
   team before resubmitting.
3. **Consider Additional Resources**: If you're stuck, consider hiring a
   consultant who specializes in App Store submissions or reaching out to the
   developer community for advice.
4. **Resubmit**: Once all issues have been addressed, resubmit your app for
   review.

## Tips for a Smooth Appeal Process

- **Be Patient**: While waiting for the App Review Board's response, don't make
  further changes or resubmit your app, as this could delay the process.
- **Be Professional**: Always communicate professionally and courteously with
  the review team.
- **Keep Records**: Maintain a record of all communications with the App Review
  team for future reference.
