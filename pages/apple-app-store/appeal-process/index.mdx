# Appeal Process

If your app has been rejected from the Apple App Store, there's a process to
appeal the decision. This page provides a step-by-step guide on how to prepare
and submit an appeal to the App Review Board.

## Understanding The Rejection

Before you appeal, it's important to thoroughly understand Apple's feedback.
Check the resolution center in your App Store Connect account for detailed
information about the rejection.

## Preparing Your Appeal

- **Review the Guidelines**: Familiarize yourself with the [App Store Review
  Guidelines](/apple-app-store/review-guidelines) to
  ensure your app complies.
- **Address the Issues**: Make the necessary changes to your app to address the
  reasons for rejection.
- **Collect Evidence**: If applicable, prepare evidence or documentation that
  supports your case or demonstrates that your app does comply with the
  guidelines.

## Writing a Clear and Concise Appeal

- **Be Professional**: Use a polite and respectful tone in your communication.
- **Be Specific**: Clearly state your disagreement with the rejection and
  reference specific guideline numbers.
- **Be Concise**: Present your facts and arguments in a clear and
  straightforward manner.
- **Include Relevant Details**: Provide your app name, version number, and any
  other details that might help the review board understand your case.

  business days.
