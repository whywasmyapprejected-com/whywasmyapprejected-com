# Ensuring Your App Meets Account Deletion Requirements

As of June 30, 2022, new regulations have been implemented that affect apps on
the App Store. Any app that offers account creation must also provide users with
the ability to delete their account directly within the app. This marks a
significant shift towards enhancing user control over personal data. Below is a
succinct guide that outlines developer obligations and highlights common
pitfalls to avoid.

## What Developers Need To Do üõ†Ô∏è

### Implement Account Deletion Functionality

- Integrate the option for account deletion within your app, preferably within
  the account settings.
- Deleting the account must purge the entire account record and any associated
  personal data, barring any legal requirements for retention.
- If a website visit is required to complete deletion, link directly to the
  relevant page.
- Inform users about delay times and how in-app purchases, subscriptions, and
  refunds are handled post-deletion.

### Guide Users Clearly

- Present the account deletion option in a conspicuous location.
- Make the process simple and transparent, avoiding any unnecessary
  complications.

### Legal Considerations

- Remain compliant with all legal frameworks concerning user data retention and
  deletion.
- Consult legal counsel if you have any uncertainties about these obligations.

### Offer Immediate Support for Account Deletion

- Even if the deletion process is manual and time-consuming, inform users of the
  expected duration.
- Provide confirmation once the deletion has been completed.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid ‚ùå

### Making Deletion Options Hard to Find

- **Solution:** Feature the delete option prominently within the app's settings or
  profile sections.

### Requiring External Steps for Completion

- **Solution:** Finalize the entire deletion within the app, without directing users
  to call customer service, unless legally permitted due to the nature of the
  industry.

### Excessive Confirmation Steps

- **Solution:** While reauthentication is fair, avoid overburdening users with
  confirmation steps.

### Neglecting Automatically Created Accounts

- **Solution:** Always provide an option to delete ‚Äúguest‚Äù or automatically
  generated accounts.

### Handling Subscriptions Poorly

- **Solution:** Notify users to cancel any ongoing subscriptions and provide clear
  instructions or links to manage their subscriptions.

### Ignoring Non-Compliance for Global Users

- **Solution:** Ensure account deletion practices are available to all users, not
  just in regions with legal requirements like the CCPA or GDPR.

## Subscription Handling üßæ

- Advise users to cancel auto-renewable subscriptions and provide links or
  instructions to manage subscriptions.
- For refund requests, direct users to Apple Support or integrate
  beginRefundRequest for requests within the app.
- Enable users to schedule account deletion to coincide with the expiration of
  their subscriptions if immediate deletion is not selected.

In summary, offering a direct, understandable, and transparent account deletion
process within your app isn't only a requirement‚Äîit's fundamental for providing
users with control over their data and complying with App Store guidelines.
Avoid common mistakes by focusing on clarity, user autonomy, and robust support
structures for managing subscriptions and providing feedback.
