# Performance Rejections

Performance is a key criterion for app acceptance in the Apple App Store. If an
app does not perform well in terms of speed, responsiveness, or stability, it is
likely to face rejection.

## Understanding it

Apple places high importance on the user experience. An app must be:

- Fast and responsive
- Free from significant bugs
- Consistent with its description
- Capable of handling data and privacy correctly

## Common Performance-Related Rejections

**Crashes and Bugs**

Any app that crashes during review will be rejected. Make sure to:

- Thoroughly test your app on devices running the latest software and fix all
  crash issues.
- Check your app's stability under various conditions, including network outages
  and low battery scenarios.

**Slow Load Times**

Apps taking too long to launch or load content can lead to rejections. To avoid
this:

- Optimize your code and assets.
- Use lazy loading techniques where applicable to speed up initial load times.

**Poor Responsiveness**

A lack of smooth interactivity or slow responses to user input are also causes
for rejections, so:

- Optimize UI and background processes.
- Prioritize tasks that affect user interaction.

**Inefficient Memory Use**

Apps that require excessive memory use can also be flagged. Ensure that your
app:

- Manages memory efficiently.
- Releases unused resources to prevent leaks and minimize footprint.

## Test Your App for Performance

**Use Xcode's Tools**

Leverage Xcode's suite of performance tools like Instruments to:

- Analyze your app's memory usage and leaks.
- Monitor CPU usage and identify potential bottlenecks.

**Beta Testing**

Utilize TestFlight to beta test your app:

- Gather feedback about performance from a wider user base.
- Identify and rectify issues before submitting to the App Store.

**Follow Apple's Guidelines**

Apple provides guidelines regarding performance, which include:

- Optimizing for the latest devices.
- Taking advantage of Apple's latest technologies for improved performance.

## Conclusion

Before submitting your app, make sure that it meets these performance standards.
Addressing these aspects not only helps in avoiding rejection but also ensures a
better experience for your users.

If you have received a performance-related rejection, evaluate the feedback,
make the necessary improvements, and resubmit your app confidently.
