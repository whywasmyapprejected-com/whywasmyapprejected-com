# Privacy Rejections

Privacy is a core aspect of the Apple App Store's guidelines. Apps that fail to
meet privacy standards are commonly rejected. Understanding these requirements
and preparing your app accordingly can make all the difference. Here, we discuss
how to address privacy concerns to avoid or overturn rejections.

## Understanding App Store Privacy Guidelines

Apple requires all apps to respect user privacy and provide transparent
information usage policies. Familiarize yourself with the key guidelines:

  Privacy](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#privacy)
- [Apple's App privacy details on the App Store](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/)

## Common Reasons for Privacy Rejections

### Insufficient Privacy Information

- **Issue:** Apps must clearly disclose data collection practices in the app's
  description and privacy policy.
- **Solution:** Ensure that your app's description, privacy policy link, and the
  purpose for data collection are clear and accessible to users.

### Data Collection Without Consent

- **Issue:** Collecting user data without obtaining consent is a violation.
- **Solution:** Implement a transparent consent mechanism before collecting any
  data from your users.

### Inadequate Data Usage Description

- **Issue:** Failing to specify why the app needs the data it collects.
- **Solution:** Clearly explain how and why the data is used, ensuring it is
  relevant to the app's functionality.

## How To Handle Privacy Rejection

1. **Review the rejection reasons:** Carefully read through Apple's feedback on
   the rejection to understand the issues.
2. **Revise your app accordingly:** Make necessary changes to your app's privacy
   features, data handling, and documentation.
3. **Resubmit your app:** After adjustments, resubmit your app for review with a
   note detailing the changes made in response to the privacy concerns.

## Crafting a Privacy Policy

Your privacy policy should be accessible and transparent. Include the following:

- Types of data collected
- Purpose of data collection
- Data retention and storage details
- Security measures
- User rights and how to exercise them
- Contact information for privacy concerns

Consider using [privacy policy generators](https://www.privacypolicies.com/)
that tailor to the App Store's requirements.
