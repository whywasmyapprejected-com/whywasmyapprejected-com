# Inconsistent UI

Inconsistent user interface elements can lead to a confusing user experience,
which is one of the reasons apps get rejected from the Apple App Store. This
page will help you understand what constitutes inconsistent UI and how to
address this issue to meet Apple's expectations.

## What Does it Mean?

Inconsistent UI refers to the use of user interface elements that do not conform
to the established design patterns of the platform. This could include:

- Customized UI elements that mimic native behaviors but fail to work as
  expected
- Varying fonts, colors, or control sizes that aren't part of a cohesive design
  system
- Non-standard gestures or interactions that confuse users by deviating from iOS
  norms

## Examples

Here are some examples of inconsistent UI and why they may lead to rejection:

### Custom Buttons That Mimic Standard iOS Controls

Creating a button that looks similar to a system button but doesn't behave the
same can result in a poor user experience.

**Fix**: Use standard iOS buttons or ensure that custom buttons have their own
distinct design and behavior that users can easily understand and use.

### Different Fonts and Colors for Similar Controls

Using multiple font styles or colors within the same category of controls (such
as all buttons) can confuse users.

**Fix**: Maintain a consistent style guide for your controls to ease the user's
navigation and interaction with your app.

### Non-Standard Gestural Controls

Introducing gesture controls that aren't common on iOS devices, such as a
double-tap to go back, can confuse users who are familiar with the traditional
swipe gesture.

**Fix**: Stick with gestural controls that are well-known and documented in
Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, or provide clear instruction within the app
if using non-standard gestures.

## How to Avoid

To avoid inconsistent UI in your app:

- **Stick to Native Components**: Wherever possible, use standard iOS components
  which are familiar to users and behave as they expect.
- **Be Purposeful in Customization**: Customize only when it serves a specific
  purpose and enhances user experience without causing confusion.
- **User Testing**: Conduct user testing to observe how your interface elements
  are perceived and used by real users.

Remember, design consistency is not just an aesthetic choice; it is fundamental
to creating an intuitive user experience. If you're facing a rejection,
carefully review feedback from Apple, compare your app's UI with their
guidelines, and make necessary adjustments.
