# Poor UI

Creating a user interface that is intuitive and enjoyable is a key factor in
getting approval from the Apple App Store. A poor UI can lead to a confusing
user experience and a likely rejection. Let's explore how to identify and
address poor UI design to prevent rejection.

## Identifying Poor UI

Poor UI design can manifest in various ways, including:

- **Complicated Navigation**: If users struggle to find essential features or
  understand how to move through your app, it's a sign of a poor UI.
- **Inconsistent UI Patterns**: Lack of consistency in UI elements like buttons,
  typefaces, and color schemes can be off-putting and confusing.
- **Lack of Visual Hierarchy**: Without a clear hierarchy, users might find it
  difficult to distinguish between elements of different importance.

## Examples

To help illustrate, here's an example of a rejection due to poor UI:

### Confusing Navigation Structure

**Issue**: The app's main features are buried in menus, and users cannot easily
return to the homepage.

**Resolution**: Simplify the navigation by using common patterns like tab bars
for main features and always including a 'home' button.

## Fixing Poor UI Issues

Improving your UI involves focusing on user experience, iterative testing, and
adhering to established design principles. Here are steps to take:

### Simplify the User Journey

- Map out the user flows and remove unnecessary steps to ensure a smoother
  experience.
- Make sure your navigation is intuitive and familiar.

### Create a Consistent Look and Feel

- Establish a clear and consistent visual language across your app.
- Utilize Apple's [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) to
  incorporate standard UI elements.

### Implement a Clear Visual Hierarchy

- Use size, color, and contrast to differentiate elements and guide user
  interaction.
- Focus on typography, ensuring readability and effective information display.

### Test and Iterate

- Conduct usability tests with a diverse set of users to gather feedback.
- Make iterative improvements based on user input and performance data.

Remember, the goal is to provide an enjoyable and frictionless experience for
the user. After adjustments are made, resubmit your app and highlight the UI
improvements in the submission notes.
