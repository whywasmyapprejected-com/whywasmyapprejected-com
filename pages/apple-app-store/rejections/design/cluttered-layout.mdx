# Cluttered Layout Rejections

A common cause for design rejections from the Apple App Store is a cluttered app
layout. An interface overloaded with elements can be confusing to users and
detract from the overall user experience.

## Understanding Cluttered Layouts

A cluttered layout typically includes:

- Overuse of buttons, text, or images on a single screen.
- Inconsistent or excessive interface elements that do not provide a clear user
  flow.
- Lack of whitespace, creating a cramped and overwhelming user experience.

## Tips for De-Cluttering Your App's Design

To create a cleaner and more streamlined design, consider the following tips:

- **Minimize On-Screen Elements**: Keep only the essentials that contribute to
  the app's functionality.
- **Use Whitespace Effectively**: Allow for adequate spacing between elements to
  improve readability and focus.
- **Simplify Navigation**: Ensure users can navigate your app with ease and
  without feeling overwhelmed.

By focusing on a minimalist and clean design, you can not only appeal to the
Apple App Store review team but also provide a more enjoyable experience for
users. If you're struggling with design or need feedback, take part in our
