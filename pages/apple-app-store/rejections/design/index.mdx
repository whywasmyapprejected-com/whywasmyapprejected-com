# Design Rejections

Understanding and adhering to the Apple App Store's design guidelines is
essential for app approval. On this page, we dive into common design-related
rejection reasons and offer guidance on how to ensure your app meets the
expected standards.

## Why Design Matters?

Apple places a high premium on the design and user experience of apps. The
design is not just about aesthetics; it's about creating an intuitive,
accessible, and user-friendly interface that aligns with the seamless experience
iOS users have come to expect.

## Common Reasons

Here are some frequent design issues that can lead to app rejections:

### Inconsistent UI Elements

Apps that use non-standard UI elements or modify standard elements in a way that
impairs functionality can be rejected.

### Poor User Interface

A UI that is complex, less intuitive, or provides a poor overall user experience
can prevent app approval.

### Copycatting

Apps that mimic other app's designs or brand features too closely can receive
rejections for lack of creativity.

### Cluttered Layout

Overcrowded screens with too many elements can lead to a negative user
experience and potential rejection.

## Best Practices

To increase the likelihood of app approval, consider these best practices:

- **Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines**: Review and adhere to Apple's
  guiding principles for design.
- **Keep It Simple**: A clean and straightforward design often leads to a better
  user experience.
- **Test Your UI**: Test usability with real users to find and fix design flaws
  before submission.
- **Consistency Is Key**: Use consistent icons, buttons, and color schemes
  throughout the app.
