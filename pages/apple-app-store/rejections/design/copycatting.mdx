# Copycatting

Apple encourages innovation and originality in the apps available on its
platform. An app that resembles another app too closely can be rejected on the
grounds of copycatting or lack of a unique design. Here's how you can avoid this
pitfall.

## What is it?

Copycatting is when an app closely mimics the design elements, functionality, or
overall feel of another app without bringing any substantial original content or
features. This includes:

- Similar app icons, layouts, or color schemes.
- Copying another app's unique gestures or user interaction models.
- Replicating proprietary features without significant differentiation.

## Create an Original Design

To ensure your app stands out and is deemed original by the App Store review
team, follow these guidelines:

- **Conduct Competitive Analysis**: Research similar apps and identify how you
  can differentiate your app's design and user experience.
- **Emphasize Unique Features**: Highlight the elements of your app that are
  unique and innovative.
- **Design With Purpose**: Make design choices that are aligned with your app's
  goals and enhance its functionality.

Remember, the goal is to design an app that provides value to users with its own
identity and style. Need help or more personalized advice? Join our [community
