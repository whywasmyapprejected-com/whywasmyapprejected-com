# Performance Guidelines

Performance is crucial for a positive user experience. Apps that crash, have
bugs, or do not perform as expected are likely to be rejected. To ace the
performance review, here's what you should focus on:

### Stability
- Test your app thoroughly to eliminate any crashes and major bugs.

### Completeness
- Make sure your app looks and feels like a finished product, not a beta
  version.

### Metadata
- Accurately represent your app's functionality in the app's metadata and
  screenshots.
