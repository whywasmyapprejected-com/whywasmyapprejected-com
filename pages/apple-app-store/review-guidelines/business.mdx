# Business Guidelines

Business practices on the App Store need to be consistent with Apple's policies.
Transparent and legal business methods ensure trust and longevity for your app
on the platform.

### In-App Purchases
- If your app offers in-app purchases, they must be clear, visible, and within
  Apple's IAP system.

### Advertisements
- Ensure all advertising in your app is appropriate for its audience and
  complies with Apple's standards.

### Legal Business Practices
- Your app must adhere to all legal requirements in any location where you make
  it available.
