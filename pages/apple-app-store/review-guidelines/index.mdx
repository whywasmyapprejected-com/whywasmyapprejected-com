## Key Areas of Focus

The guidelines are comprehensive, but key areas include:

- **Safety**: Apps must provide a safe experience for users.
- **Performance**: Apps must work as promised and not have any major bugs.
- **Business**: Apps must follow legal and ethical practices for transactions.
- **Design**: Apps must be straightforward and user-friendly, matching Apple's
  design aesthetics.

  collection.

We have summarized these sections with actionable advice and things to watch out
for when submitting your app.

When developing your app, ensure that:
