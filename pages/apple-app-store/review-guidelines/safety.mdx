# Safety Guidelines

Safety is a top priority for users and Apple alike. Ensuring your app aligns with Apple's safety guidelines not only promotes a healthier app environment but also increases the chances of your app being approved during the review process.

**Here are the key aspects of safety you should consider:**

### Content Moderation
- Implement effective measures to moderate user-generated content.
- Provide users with tools to report inappropriate content.

### User Data Security
- Use strong encryption methods to protect user data.
- Collect only the data necessary for your app to function.

### Child Protection
- Follow guidelines under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) if your app is directed at children.
- Implement parental controls for in-app purchases and content access.
